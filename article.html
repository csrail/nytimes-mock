             Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &#8212; One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year&#39;s appointment 
          at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
          venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
          A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
          have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
          of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
          wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, 
          but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          &#8220;SPECTACULAR REALIZATION&#8221;, Dr. Guth wrote across the 
          top of the page and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          On Monday, Dr. Guth&#39;s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that 
          his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a class="story-body__anchor" href="#">first sliver of 
          cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers 
          led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time &#8212; 
          so-called <a href="#" class="story-body__anchor">gravitational waves</a> &#8212; the signature of a universe 
          being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
          trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
          smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his 
          colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle 
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. 
          Dr. Kovac&#39;s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
          gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein&#39;s theory of 
          general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe 
          expert who was not part of the team, said, &#8220;This is huge, as big as 
          it gets.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          He continued, &#8220;This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one 
          in 10 million.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself &#8220;bowled over,&#8221; 
          saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          &#8220;With nature, you have to be lucky,&#8221; he said. &#8220;
          Apparently we have been lucky.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years&#39; 
          worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a 
          leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select 
          few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts 
          Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that 
          night in 1979), in his office last week.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          &#8220;It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously 
          as scientists,&#8221; said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as 
          carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the 
          most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 
          1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when 
          Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac&#39;s 
          team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the 
          news.

          Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered 
          anything.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a 
          delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply 
          forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote 
          in an email.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he 
          was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of 
          spoiling a vacation,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that 
          inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded 
          with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think 
          that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest 
          discoveries in the history of science.”
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor 
          and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, 
          pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are 
          beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation 
          that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, 
          said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he 
          expressed reservations about inflation.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the 
          need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier 
          estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the 
          European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about 
          the universe.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. 
          Krauss said.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will 
          report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are 
          trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

          Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
