          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &#8212; One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year&#39;s appointment 
          at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
          venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
          A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
          have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
          of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
          wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, 
          but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">

        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          On Monday, Dr. Guth&#39;s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that 
          his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a class="story-body__anchor" href="#">first sliver of

          led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time &#8212; 
          so-called <a href="#" class="story-body__anchor">gravitational waves</a> &#8212; the signature of a universe 
          being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
          trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
          smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle 
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. 
          Dr. Kovac&#39;s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
          gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein&#39;s theory of 
          general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe

        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself &#8220;bowled over,&#8221;

        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years&#39; 
          worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a 
          leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select 
          few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts 
          Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that 
          night in 1979), in his office last week.

          &#8220;It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously

          carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the 
          most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 
          1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when 
          Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac&#39;s

          &#8220;And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a

          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation

          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the

          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave 
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight 
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the 
          gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in 
          one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist 
          the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a 
          result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows 
          going in spirals.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small 
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group&#39;s 
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

          The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent

          single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest 
          moments.

        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall 
          from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling 
          out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force 
          after another splitting away.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          That was where Dr. Guth came in.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the 
          temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which 
          point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Similarly, the universe could &#8220;supercool&#8221; and stay in a unified state 
          too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a 
          mysterious latent energy.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Inserted into Einstein&#39;s equations, the latent energy would act as a 
          kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it 
          was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was 
          created, the harder it pushed apart.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least 
          a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial 
          energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary 
          particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, 
          resulting in today&#39;s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars 
          billions of light-years across. &#8220;It&#39;s often said that there is no such 
          thing as a free lunch,&#8221; Dr. Guth likes to say, &#8220;but the universe might 
          be the ultimate free lunch.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting 
          from Dr. Guth&#39;s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, 
          is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable 
          homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, 
          spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not 
          bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
        </p>
        <p class="story-body__paragraph">
          We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very 
          beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. 
          All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.

          &#8220;If you trace your cosmic roots,&#8221; said Abraham Loeb, a 
          Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, &#8220;you 
          wind up at inflation.&#8221;
